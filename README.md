# tovala-recipes

Hi! I've you're reading this you are something of a coding nerd like me. Or, perhaps you are in the wrong spot. Unfortunately I don't have a "write" spot to suggest to anyone who doesn't understand code, so, umm... yeah... In the future though...

Here's the quick tour:

   recipes/  <- This is where the actual recipe data lives
   code/ <- Pretty much everhting else
   docs/ <- Except for non-recipe details. Those go here

The idea is to collect recipes that are highly reproducible using the Tovala smart oven. At first the recipe collection is going to be rather free-form in markdown, but over time we might be able to move this to some sort of machine readable format. These exist right? I have no idea and have done no research - yet.

So individual recipes go into sub-directories of the recipes folder and we'll add hierarchy as appropriate over time. Initially in markdown.

Code to present the recipes in a nice format will go in the code directory. One can imagine all sorts of presentations built from the same source data.

Standards about formats and what not will be in docs - again in markdown.
